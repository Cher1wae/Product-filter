                        Ernesto "Che" Guevara was an Argentine Marxist revolutionary, physician, author, guerrilla
                        leader,
                        diplomat, and military theorist. A major figure of the Cuban Revolution, his stylized visage has
                        become a ubiquitous countercultural symbol of rebellion and global insignia in popular culture.
